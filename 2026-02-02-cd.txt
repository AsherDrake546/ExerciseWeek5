  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> create a multi-page static html5 website for Mangu Mountain Dominican     
  cuisine, a restaurant in Kissimmee FL. I need: index.html (homepage),     
  about.html, menu.html, and contact.html. make sure every page has a       
  navbar to access other pages and use modern, proffessional styling with   
  responsive design. for the color palette stick to #EAE8FF, #ADACB5        
  #2D3142, and #B0D7FF. use proper information architecture practices       

● I'll create the website with a shared CSS file and all 4 pages. Let me build
  them all in parallel.

      187    font-family: var(--font-heading);
      188    font-size: 3rem;

● Done. The homepage hero now has a full-width background image slideshow that
  crossfades between the 3 images every 5 seconds:

  - mangucontresgolpes.webp (starts visible)
  - polloguisado.jpg
  - chivoguisado.jpg

  The images are behind a dark overlay (rgba(45,49,66, 0.65)) so the white text
  remains readable. The transition uses a 1.5s opacity fade for a smooth
  crossfade effect. The hero section is also taller now (min-height: 520px) to 
  give the images more presence.

✻ Crunched for 47s

> add an effect where the background images slightly zoom in or out

● Done. Here's what was updated on the menu page:

  - Category images — Each section now has a banner image at the top with
  rounded corners:
    - Breakfast: mangucontresgolpes.webp
    - Entrees: polloguisado.jpg
    - Appetizers: torrejas.jpg
    - Drinks: cafe.webp
    - Desserts: tresleches.jpg
  - New menu item — Added "Torrejas de Yuca Fritas" ($7.99) to the appetizers
  section with a description of crispy fried cassava fritters with garlic sauce

✻ Cooked for 1m 37s

> make the images display in a more square aspect ration and to the right   
  of the menu categories. also change cassava to yuca in the description of 
  the torrejas

● I need to restructure each menu category to have a two-column layout with
  content on the left and the image on the right. Let me update the HTML
  structure and CSS.

  First, widen the container and restructure all categories.

      42        <!-- Desayuno / Breakfast -->
      43        <div class="menu-category">

● Now I'll restructure each category to wrap the items in a menu-category__items
   div and move the image into a side-by-side layout. Let me read the full menu
  section and rewrite it.

● I'll restructure all 5 categories to use a two-column layout and fix the
  torrejas description.

      626      grid-template-columns: 1fr;
      627      gap: 2rem;

● Done. Here's what changed:

  - Layout — Each menu category is now a two-column grid with the menu items on
  the left and a 280x280px square image on the right
  - Sticky images — The images stick near the top as you scroll through longer
  categories (like entrees)
  - Torrejas description — Changed "cassava" to "yuca"
  - Responsive — On mobile (768px and below), images go full-width above the
  items and stack vertically

✻ Cooked for 1m 33s

> The images are scrolling separate from the page sometimes, make them      
  scroll at the same rate as everything else

● Now fix the slideshow animation to eliminate the snap-back. The issue is that
  when a slide loses the active class, transform jumps back to scale(1)
  instantly before fading out. I need to keep the zoomed state during the
  fade-out.

  zoomed scale while fading out.

      187      }, 5000);
      188    </script>
      189  

● Done. Two changes made:

  Testimonials section — Added between the CTA banner and Fan Favorites with:
  - A "4.7 stars on Google Reviews" header with gold star icons
  - Three testimonial cards with quotes mentioning specific menu items

  Slideshow animation fix — When a slide transitions out, it now gets a prev
  class that holds it at scale(1.08) while it fades to opacity 0. This
  eliminates the jarring snap-back to the original size before the crossfade.

      187    font-family: var(--font-heading);
      188    font-size: 3rem;

● Done. The homepage hero now has a full-width background image slideshow that
  crossfades between the 3 images every 5 seconds:

  - mangucontresgolpes.webp (starts visible)
  - polloguisado.jpg
  - chivoguisado.jpg

  The images are behind a dark overlay (rgba(45,49,66, 0.65)) so the white text
  remains readable. The transition uses a 1.5s opacity fade for a smooth
  crossfade effect. The hero section is also taller now (min-height: 520px) to 
  give the images more presence.

✻ Crunched for 47s

      46 -          <p>When we opened our doors in Kissimmee, our mission

● Done. Here's what changed:

  - Layout — Each menu category is now a two-column grid with the menu items on
  the left and a 280x280px square image on the right
  - Sticky images — The images stick near the top as you scroll through longer
  categories (like entrees)
  - Torrejas description — Changed "cassava" to "yuca"
  - Responsive — On mobile (768px and below), images go full-width above the
  items and stack vertically

✻ Cooked for 1m 33s

> The images are scrolling separate from the page sometimes, make them      
  scroll at the same rate as everything else

> on the home page, add a testimonials section that also mentions a 4.7     
  star rating on google reviews. also adjust the animation on the images to 
  remove the sudden shift back to the original image size before the fade   
  to the next image begins

● Now fix the slideshow animation to eliminate the snap-back. The issue is that
  when a slide loses the active class, transform jumps back to scale(1)
  instantly before fading out. I need to keep the zoomed state during the
  fade-out.

      182    from {
      183      transform: scale(1);

● Now update the JS to apply the prev class so the outgoing slide holds its
  zoomed scale while fading out.

● Update(week2Exercise\index.html)
  ⎿  Added 7 lines, removed 1 line
      175      const slides = document.querySelectorAll('.hero__slide');

      181        current = (current + 1) % slides.length;
      182 +      slides[current].classList.remove('prev');

      185 +        slides[prev].classList.remove('prev');                
      186 +      }, 1500);                                               
      187      }, 5000);
      188    </script>
      189  

● Done. Two changes made:

  Testimonials section — Added between the CTA banner and Fan Favorites with:
  - A "4.7 stars on Google Reviews" header with gold star icons
  - Three testimonial cards with quotes mentioning specific menu items

  Slideshow animation fix — When a slide transitions out, it now gets a prev
  class that holds it at scale(1.08) while it fades to opacity 0. This
  eliminates the jarring snap-back to the original size before the crossfade.

      187    font-family: var(--font-heading);
      188    font-size: 3rem;

● Done. The homepage hero now has a full-width background image slideshow that
  crossfades between the 3 images every 5 seconds:

  - mangucontresgolpes.webp (starts visible)
  - polloguisado.jpg
  - chivoguisado.jpg

  The images are behind a dark overlay (rgba(45,49,66, 0.65)) so the white text
  remains readable. The transition uses a 1.5s opacity fade for a smooth
  crossfade effect. The hero section is also taller now (min-height: 520px) to 
  give the images more presence.

✻ Crunched for 47s

> add an effect where the background images slightly zoom in or out

  scale(1.08) over the 5-second display duration. The overflow: hidden on the

  - Story section — Rewritten to introduce Mangu Mountain as a family-owned
  restaurant, highlight the comfort food menu (mangu, rice & beans, tostones,
  beef stew), and tell Antonio Paulino's story as a second-generation
  Dominican-American chef working to spread Dominican cuisine
  - Image — Replaced the placeholder with img/antonio.jpg showing Antonio, with
  a rounded border and cover fit
  - Mission section — Updated to reflect Antonio's goal of getting Dominican
  food more widely recognized

✻ Cogitated for 33s

● Added object-position: top so the image anchors to the top, keeping Antonio's
  face visible instead of cropping from the center. If it still looks off, let
  me know and I can adjust further (e.g. center 20%).

● Changed the height from 360px to 500px, giving the image a taller, more
  portrait-style aspect ratio. Let me know if you'd like it even taller.

  - New menu item — Added "Torrejas de Yuca Fritas" ($7.99) to the appetizers
  section with a description of crispy fried cassava fritters with garlic sauce

✻ Cooked for 1m 37s

> make the images display in a more square aspect ration and to the right   
  of the menu categories. also change cassava to yuca in the description of 
  the torrejas

● Done. Here's what changed:

  - Layout — Each menu category is now a two-column grid with the menu items on
  the left and a 280x280px square image on the right
  - Sticky images — The images stick near the top as you scroll through longer
  categories (like entrees)
  - Torrejas description — Changed "cassava" to "yuca"
  - Responsive — On mobile (768px and below), images go full-width above the
  items and stack vertically

✻ Cooked for 1m 33s

> The images are scrolling separate from the page sometimes, make them      
  scroll at the same rate as everything else

● Now fix the slideshow animation to eliminate the snap-back. The issue is that
  when a slide loses the active class, transform jumps back to scale(1)
  instantly before fading out. I need to keep the zoomed state during the
  fade-out.

● Now update the JS to apply the prev class so the outgoing slide holds its
  zoomed scale while fading out.

● Update(week2Exercise\index.html)
  ⎿  Added 7 lines, removed 1 line
      175      const slides = document.querySelectorAll('.hero__slide');
      176      let current = 0;
      177      setInterval(() => {
      178 -      slides[current].classList.remove('active');             
      178 +      const prev = current;                                   
      179 +      slides[prev].classList.remove('active');                
      180 +      slides[prev].classList.add('prev');                     
      181        current = (current + 1) % slides.length;
      182 +      slides[current].classList.remove('prev');               
      183        slides[current].classList.add('active');
      184 +      setTimeout(() => {                                      
      185 +        slides[prev].classList.remove('prev');                
      186 +      }, 1500);                                               
      187      }, 5000);
      188    </script>
      189  

● Done. Two changes made:

  Testimonials section — Added between the CTA banner and Fan Favorites with:
  - A "4.7 stars on Google Reviews" header with gold star icons
  - Three testimonial cards with quotes mentioning specific menu items

  Slideshow animation fix — When a slide transitions out, it now gets a prev
  class that holds it at scale(1.08) while it fades to opacity 0. This
  eliminates the jarring snap-back to the original size before the crossfade.
